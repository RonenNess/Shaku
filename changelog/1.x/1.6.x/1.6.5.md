## 1.6.5

- Optimized gfx by caching rendering region internally.
- Optimized gfx by caching some variables + simpler bounding rect calculation when there's no rotation or skew.
- Optimized gfx by reducing buffer bind calls when drawing batches.
- Optimized gfx by not slicing arrays when we don't have to.
- Added log warning if couldn't get WebGL2 and fallback to WebGL1.
