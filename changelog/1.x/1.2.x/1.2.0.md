## 1.2.0

- Added collision detection manager.
- Added `outlineRect` to gfx manager.
- Added `fillCircle` to gfx manager.
- Added `outlineCircle` to gfx manager.
- Changed the topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight getters in `Rectangle` to be 'getXXX' methods (breaking change).
- - Why: if its a getter you can do `rect.topLeft.x = ...` which implies you can change it, but you can't. also now its more consistent with getSize() and getCenter().
- Fixed all rotations to go clockwise, to be more industry standard (breaking change).
- Small default-color optimization in gfx manager.
- Added `Invert` Blend Mode.
- Added `Darken` Blend Mode.
- Renamed `drawLines` to `drawLinesStrip` and added real `drawLines` (breaking change).
- Changed few exceptions to error logs to be softer on rendering errors.
- Added `throwErrorOnWarnings()` to allow more strict mode.
- Fixed rectangle-rectangle collision to include touching borders (breaking change).
- Fixed `collideCircle()` bug.
- Added plus / minus key codes.
